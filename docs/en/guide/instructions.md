## Millions rows of data

Currently limited by the maximum height restriction of the browser, the scrollbar cannot continue to scroll after exceeding a certain height. In the example, the data limit is approximately 380,000 rows. The author plans to implement the display of millions of rows of data by simulating the scrollbar themselves in future updates.

## scrolling performance

This virtual list supports full-frame rendering, but in scenarios with large data or complex DOM, users should actively avoid two issues:

1. List data should use non-reactive data `ShallowRef` instead of reactive data `Ref`.
2. Complex DOM should separate the rendering layer and interaction layer. The rendering layer DOM should be extremely simple.

## fix selection

Fixed a bug in the Vue 2 diff algorithm (during the downward scrolling of the list, the Vue 2 diff algorithm would cause the entire list to remount).

## shallowRef

Whether you are using VirtList or VirtGrid, once you use shallowRef, you need to use the provided forceUpdate method to update the list when its length changes. For changes to item content, you should manually use renderKey to trigger the corresponding updates.
